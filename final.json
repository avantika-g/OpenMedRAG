        "question": "What are some of the diverse functions of proteins in living systems?",
        "answer": "Proteins are the most abundant and functionally diverse molecules in living systems. They serve as enzymes and polypeptide hormones that direct and regulate metabolism in the body. Contractile proteins in muscle permit movement. In bone, collagen forms a framework for calcium phosphate crystal deposition. In blood, proteins like hemoglobin and albumin transport essential molecules, while immunoglobulins fight infectious bacteria and viruses.",

        "answer": "There are 20 standard amino acids commonly found as constituents of mammalian proteins. These standard amino acids are the only amino acids that are encoded by DNA, the genetic material in the cell. Nonstandard amino acids are produced by chemical modification of standard amino acids.",

        "question": "Describe the basic structural components of an amino acid.",
        "answer": "Each amino acid has a carboxyl group, a primary amino group (except for proline, which has a secondary amino group), and a distinctive side chain (R group) bonded to the α carbon atom. At physiologic pH (~7.4), the carboxyl group is dissociated, forming the negatively charged carboxylate ion (−COO−), and the amino group is protonated (−NH3+).",

    {
        "question": "Explain the hydrophobic effect in protein structure and its importance.",
        "answer": "The hydrophobic effect occurs when the side chains of nonpolar amino acids tend to cluster together in the interior of a protein in aqueous solutions. This phenomenon happens because the nonpolar R groups act like oil droplets that coalesce in an aqueous environment. By filling up the interior of the folded protein, these nonpolar R groups help give the protein its three-dimensional shape. For proteins located in hydrophobic environments like membranes, the nonpolar R groups are found on the outside surface, interacting with the lipid environment.",

        "question": "What makes proline unique among amino acids, and how does this affect protein structure?",
        "answer": "Proline differs from other amino acids in that its side chain and α-amino nitrogen form a rigid, five-membered ring structure. This gives proline a secondary (rather than a primary) amino group, and it is frequently referred to as an \"imino acid.\" The unique geometry of proline contributes to the formation of the fibrous structure of collagen, but it interrupts the α-helices found in globular proteins.",

        "question": "What is a disulfide bond, and what is its significance in protein structure?",
        "answer": "A disulfide bond is a covalent cross-link that forms when the sulfhydryl (thiol) groups (−SH) of two cysteine residues are oxidized, creating a −S−S− linkage. Two disulfide-linked cysteines are referred to as cystine. Disulfide bonds are important for protein stability, particularly in extracellular proteins like albumin, a blood protein that functions as a transporter for various molecules.",

        "question": "Which amino acid has a side chain that can ionize within the physiologic pH range, and why is this property important?",
        "answer": "Histidine is the only amino acid with a side chain that can ionize within the physiologic pH range. When incorporated into a protein, its R group can be either positively charged (protonated) or neutral, depending on the ionic environment provided by the protein. This important property contributes to the buffering role histidine plays in the functioning of proteins such as hemoglobin.",

        "question": "Explain the system for one-letter symbols used to designate amino acids.",
        "answer": "The one-letter codes for amino acids follow several rules: (1) If only one amino acid begins with a given letter, then that letter is used as its symbol (e.g., V = valine). (2) If more than one amino acid begins with a particular letter, the most common of these amino acids receives this letter as its symbol (e.g., G = glycine). (3) Some one-letter symbols sound like the amino acid they represent (e.g., F = phenylalanine, W = tryptophan). (4) For the remaining amino acids, a one-letter symbol is assigned that is as close in the alphabet as possible to the initial letter of the amino acid (e.g., K = lysine).",

    {
        "question": "What are D and L amino acid isomers, and which form is found in mammalian proteins?",
        "answer": "Because the α-carbon of an amino acid is attached to four different chemical groups (with glycine as an exception), it is an asymmetric (chiral) atom. Amino acids with a chiral α-carbon exist in two different isomeric forms, designated D and L, which are enantiomers or mirror images. All amino acids found in mammalian proteins are of the L configuration. D-amino acids are found in some antibiotics and in bacterial cell walls.",

        "question": "What is the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and how is it applied to amino acids?",
        "answer": "The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pH = pKa + log[A−]/[HA]) describes the quantitative relationship between the pH of a solution and the concentration of a weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A−). For amino acids, this equation can be used to analyze the dissociation of their ionizable groups. For example, the dissociation constant of the carboxyl group of an amino acid is called K1, and the equation becomes: pH = pK1 + log[II]/[I], where I is the fully protonated form and II is the isoelectric form of the amino acid.",

        "question": "Define the isoelectric point (pI) of an amino acid and explain how it is calculated for an amino acid with two dissociable groups.",
        "answer": "The isoelectric point (pI) is the pH at which an amino acid is electrically neutral, meaning the sum of the positive charges equals the sum of the negative charges. For an amino acid such as alanine that has only two dissociable hydrogens (one from the α-carboxyl and one from the α-amino group), the pI is the average of pK1 and pK2 (pI = [pK1 + pK2]/2). The pI corresponds to the pH at which the zwitterionic form (with a net charge of zero) predominates and at which there are also equal amounts of the positively charged and negatively charged forms.",

        "question": "How do buffers work, and what makes amino acids potential buffer components?",
        "answer": "A buffer is a solution that resists change in pH following the addition of an acid or base. It can be created by mixing a weak acid (HA) with its conjugate base (A−). Maximum buffering capacity occurs at a pH equal to the pKa. Amino acids can act as buffers because they contain weakly acidic α-carboxyl groups and weakly basic α-amino groups. Additionally, some amino acids contain ionizable groups in their side chains. For example, in alanine, the −COOH/−COO− pair can serve as a buffer in the pH region around pK1, and the −NH3+/−NH2 pair can buffer in the region around pK2.",
